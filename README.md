# MyPortfolio

My name is Aaron G. This repository is a collection of examples of code that solved challenges in work and school. None are the final products used for employers or class, and the data used comes from publicly available sources. At present it includes:
- an aws spark team project for class that was presented to AWS that ultimately loaded the results in a [quarto website](https://lucyjulian.georgetown.domains/ppol567-final-project-team6/docs/summary.html). This project utilized reddit pushift data and has a slide deck that links to the site as well.
- Basic ML pipelines:
    - a simple machine learning pipeline examining national depression rates and merging and melting various data sources. It tests alternative equations and compares them visually. It also includes a set of Jupyter notebook slides.
    - a more complex machine learning pipeline that tests multiple outcomes for fertility rate predictions across unbalanced outcome variables.
- the etl and shiny code used to generate the following website on [energy development](https://bgrus22.shinyapps.io/EnergyDevelopmentAnalysis/). It was the code for a class project that was later transformed and improved upon for a client's dashboard (what is included is the portion that was submitted for school purposes). 
- a series of regressions and visualizations examining data from different TidyTuesdays (TT)
    - first is hotel cancellations based on data from TidyTuesday Feb 11, 2020
- an example of utilizing beautiful soup and SQL to analyze bilateral investment treaties (currently being developed)
