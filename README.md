# MyPortfolio

My name is Aaron G. This repository is a collection of examples of code I have done outside of work. At present it includes:
- an example of utilizing beautiful soup and SQL to analyze bilateral investment treaties (currently being developed)
- a simple machine learning pipeline examining national depression rates and merging and melting various data sources. It tests alternative equations and compares them visually. It also includes a set of Jupyter notebook slides
- a more complext machine learning pipeline that tests multiple outcomes for fertility rate predictions
