# MyPortfolio

My name is Aaron G. This repository is a collection of examples of code that solved challenges in work and school. None are the final products used for employers or class, and the data used comes from publicly available sources. At present it includes:
- an example of utilizing beautiful soup and SQL to analyze bilateral investment treaties (currently being developed)
- a simple machine learning pipeline examining national depression rates and merging and melting various data sources. It tests alternative equations and compares them visually. It also includes a set of Jupyter notebook slides
- a series of regressions and visualizations examining hotel cancellations based on data from TidyTuesday Feb 11, 2020 (currently being developed)
- a more complext machine learning pipeline that tests multiple outcomes for fertility rate predictions across unbalanced outcome variables
