    "Although traditional media formats are still in vogue, the internet has increasingly become a means by which individuals gain news. This brings in several considerations as the sentiment of the news aritcles read affects user sentiment on the topics and the various media corporations compete to gain attention. Numerous platforms exist in this space, with varying levels of restrictions, but through examinining a less restrictive platform we believe that we may find underlying trends in the most popular stories of the internet on major news events of the world.

    "When considering the previously mentioned options for news consumption, reddit might not be the first that people jump to. That being said, Reddit as a platform gives a lot of discretion to the subreddits to determine what sort of constraints are placed on the content being posted. Therefore, R/worldnews seems like an obvious candidate for analysis given that its users are assumed to be more politicaly neutral than the other prominent subreddits, it is not exclusively U.S. centric, and has a very open policy regarding community behavior. Unlike subreddits where moderator interventions may significantly limit user behavior, aside from the laws of a country the user resides in, users on this subreddit need only worry about their karma scores, the reddit analogue to the like mechanism social media has universaly adopted."
